# SteveJobs AI Chat

This project contains a minimal Flask web application that uses the OpenAI API to simulate conversations with Steve Jobs. The responses are generated by an AI model and should not be interpreted as genuine messages from the real Steve Jobs.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app/app.py
   ```
4. Open `http://localhost:5000` in your browser to start chatting.

This project is for educational and entertainment purposes only. It is not affiliated with Apple Inc. or the estate of Steve Jobs.
